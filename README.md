# conference-database
A Java-based database of STEM/computer science conferences. 

The idea of this database was for it to be used from students, educators, and professionals to find conferences that would best align with their academic and career goals. If someone wants to find conferences on certain topics like AI or Cloud Computing or if someone wanted to find conferences where a particular company will be attending.

Conferences and companies are based on real data, though much of the information is fabricated due to missing information.
Event names were pulled from SHPE 2019 and GHC 2019.
The relationships are not real and were randomized based on ID.

For the project, we had to create 10 queries.
Some of the queries allows the user to select different attributes.

All but the Java connection was coded from scratch.
